>>>Pros and Cons of Binary Search in C
>>Pros of Binary Search
It is efficient because it continually divides the search space in half until it finds the element or only one element remains in the list to be tested.
It specifies whether the element searched is before or after the current place in the list.
It is the fastest searching algorithm with the worst-case time complexity of O(log N) and works best for large lists.
>>Cons of Binary Search
The list/array must be sorted before applying the binary search algorithm. For example, with lists where elements are added constantly, it is difficult to make a list remain sorted.
It is a little more complicated than a linear search searching an element from the list.
It is not that efficient compared to other searching algorithms for smaller list/array sizes.
